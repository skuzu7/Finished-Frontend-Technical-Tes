## Description

This project is a frontend application built with Vue.js, enabling users to retrieve and view historical price data for various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Dacxi, Ethereum, and Cosmos. It's designed as a testing ground for those looking to integrate Vue.js in their projects while dealing with real-world data from cryptocurrency markets.

### Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: Selected for its progressive features and ease of integration, Vue facilitates building scalable applications with a component-based architecture, making it a perfect fit for dynamic web applications like this one.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that accelerates development times and helps in maintaining a cleaner and more readable codebase by reducing the need for excessive CSS files.
- **Axios**: This promise-based HTTP client is crucial for handling asynchronous requests to external services, simplifying the process of fetching data and managing server responses.
- **Node.js**: Utilized as a JavaScript runtime environment that helps in setting up the server and managing various project dependencies efficiently.
